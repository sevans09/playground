## LeetCode solutions

The purpose of this repository is to practice creating solutions to interview-style coding questions and to have some fun.
Problems were given on LeetCode.

Most problems were solved in C++, since that is the language I am most comfortable with. I also tried a few problems in Golang, Python, SQL, and C.
